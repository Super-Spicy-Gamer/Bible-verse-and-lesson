                    Revelations 21:4: "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”

        </p>
        Lesson:
        <ol style="color: white;">
            <li> Revelation is often considered a scary, bold chapter of the bible. Unbelievable. Dragons, destruction, and wrath. </li>
            <li> But in the midst of destruction is peace. God will come for his children. </li>
            <li> For the children of God, there is forgiveness. </li>

        </p>
        <p>
            God is just. God will destroy sin. But we don't have to be destroyed in it. We can have life. We may cry, but weeping is temporary.
        </p>
        <p> Look at your life. What have you given it to? What have you lost? Posessions, knowledge, fame, even human life is temporary. We all must die</p>
        <p> Unless:  Revelation 21:3-4</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                ‘Never again will they hunger;
                never again will they thirst.
                The sun will not beat down on them,’
                nor any scorching heat.
                For the Lamb at the center of the throne
                will be their shepherd;
                ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’
                ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’
            </ol>
