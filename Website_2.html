  <br>John 8:12: "When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'"</br>
  <br>How is Jesus the light of the world? Well, according to Scripture,</br>
  <br>John 1:4-5: "In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."</br>
  <br>Jesus is the light because he lights up the darkness. He brings the Truth to the world full of lies. Further,</br>
  <br>Ephesians 5:13: "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.”</br>
  <br>If you are a follower of Christ, it's time to act like the light you've been called to. You are called to illuminate. In other words, to bring the Truth to the world full of lies. What is this Truth?</br>
  <br>John 14:6: "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"</br>
  <br>You are called to show the world Jesus. Don't be afraid. The world is sick, and,</br>
  <br>Luke 5:31: "Jesus answered them, 'It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.'"</br>
  <br>So go, and make disciples who make disciples, and always remember,</br>
  <br>Ephesians 5:15-16: "Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. </br>
