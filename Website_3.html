    <p>Remember our verse from the first page? It's a book from revelation. Revelation is all about the future. Many read this book and think that God's children are blind-
        it hasn't happened yet and it never will. They say "soon" every generation, and every generation they die.
    </p>
    <p>2 Peter 3:9: The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.</p>
    <p>Sure, he could come down any time and destroy evil. Maybe he should start with you. Or me. Or any of us humans. After all, scripture says:</p>
    <p>1 John 1:8: “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.”</p>
    <p>So, come to Christ. No need to fear death once you have life. Below there is a video recource. If the video doesn't work, here's the link: </p>

    <p>Consider your eternity as you watch.</p>
